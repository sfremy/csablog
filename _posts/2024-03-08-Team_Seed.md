## General Personal Plans

### Person 1 (Aiden):
- Create frontend/api
- Display data passed/recieved between API and Model in JSON

### Person 2 (Remy):
- For 3-person Titanic model exercise - setup backend for Titanic

### Person 3 (Rayne):
- will work on the model (find data using kaggle regarding betting on NBA games) and incorporate it into the notebook in a similar style to the titanic example
- will use chat gpt to help me create a skeleton for the model

## Project Outline
<p>The goal of the project is to take statistics of NBA teams/players and project performance, allowing observers to make reliable bets on said teams/players. To achieve this, the following features are needed:</p>

- Selection/Search of players, teams, statistics of interest - this requires accessing and searching the dataset for matches
- Training a model based on data obtained from an online repository
- Projection of performance for selected teams/individuals
- Projected monetary payout using a expected value calculation (needs research into actual sports betting)

<p>The repository we use can be obtained here: https://github.com/sfremy/tri3_machine_learning.git</p>

<p>Every member will report progress and plans weekly.</p>
